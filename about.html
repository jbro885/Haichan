  <h1>Haichan</h1>
  <br />
  <p>Haichan is an imageboard that runs entirely on the BSV blockchain.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Every time you make a post on Haichan, you're also writing a transaction to the blockchain.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The post itself is embedded as data inside the transaction.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Every post can be referenced by the wallet address that was used to sign the transaction. This means that <i>everything</i> you do can not only be tipped, but monetized.</p>
  <br />
  <p>If you post a meme and it gets re-posted or goes viral, you'll receive tips each time the image is posted.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The b:// image protocol is the current standard for on-chain images and media. Because any content stored on the blockchain is immutable, these links can be re-used indefinitely across any compatible service.</p>
  <br />
  <p><i>For example, you could upload a meme on Twetch, and then someone else might use that same meme in their Haichan thread, which is then linked to on Open Directory, and so on.</i></p>
  <br />
  <p>To post on Haichan, you'll need a compatible web wallet such as <a href="https://moneybutton.com">Money Button</a> or <a href="https://one.relayx.io/">RelayOne</a>, as well as some Bitcoin SV to get started. If you don't have any BSV and don't know where to get any, join our <a href="https://t.me/Haich">Telegram</a> group or shoot us an <a href="j@haich.us">email</a>.</p>
